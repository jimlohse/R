# R
initial commit/publish

The IN-PROGRESS stuff is at https://github.com/jimlohse/R/tree/master/PaulsR-eality

Check the Slack channel to see my updates and suggestions of what to do with these files, Shiny is REALLY COOL

I will put up a pretty MD file later, right now I am integrating Paul's work into the Shiny environment.

Also I will eventually get https://jimlohse.shinyapps.io/PaulsR-eality working but probably not tonight,
I need to hear back from the colorPicker developer on how to get his dependency on V8 to work on shinyapps.io
